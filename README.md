Fyyur
-----

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

## Overview

This is a CRUD app feeds off real data (not actually true, lol)! There exists model interactions, which makes possible; store, retrieve, and update data (CRUD) from a database. This is a fully functioning site that is at least capable of doing the following, if not more, using a PostgreSQL database:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

Fyyur could be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies
The tech stack will include the following:
 * **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
 * **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
 * **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
 * **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
 * **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
pip install psycopg2
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pip install Flask-WTF
pip install jinja2
pip install python-dateutil
pip install Babel
pip install phonenumbers
pip install pycodestyle
```

We advise to look up the requirements.txt file for a complete list of dependencies.

> **Note** - If we do not mention the specific version of a package, then the default latest stable package will be installed. 

### 2. Frontend Dependencies
You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.
```
node -v
npm -v
```
Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:
```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```


## Main Files: Project Structure

  ```sh
  ├── README.md
  ├── app.py *** the main driver of the app. Includes our SQLAlchemy models.
                    "python app.py" to run after installing dependencies
  ├── config.py *** Database URLs, CSRF generation, etc
  ├── error.log
  ├── forms.py *** Your forms
  ├── requirements.txt *** The dependencies we need to install with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  ├── static

  └── templates
      ├── errors
      ├── forms
      ├── layouts
      └── pages
  ```

Overall:
* Models are located in the `MODELS` section of `app.py`.
* Controllers are also located in `app.py`.
* The web frontend is located in `templates/`, which builds static assets deployed to the web server at `static/`.
* Web forms for creating data are located in `form.py`


Highlight folders:
* `templates/pages` -- Defines the pages that are rendered to the site. These templates render views based on data passed into the template’s view, in the controllers defined in `app.py`. These pages successfully represent the data to the user, and are already defined for you.
* `templates/layouts` -- Defines the layout that a page can be contained in to define footer and header code for a given page.
* `templates/forms` -- Defines the forms used to create new artists, shows, and venues.
* `app.py` -- Defines routes that match the user’s URL, and controllers which handle data and renders views to the user. This is the main file you will be working on to connect to and manipulate the database and render views with data to the user, based on the URL.
* Models in `app.py` -- Defines the data models that set up the database tables.
* `config.py` -- Stores configuration variables and instructions, separate from the main application code. This is where you will need to connect to the database.


Instructions
-----

1. Migration folder has been provided. Ensure to run our migrations to initialize the data models in your local machine. This will ensure everything works as designed.

#### Data Handling with `Flask-WTF` Forms
The starter codes use an interactive form builder library called [Flask-WTF](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/). This library provides useful functionality, such as form validation and error handling. You can peruse the Show, Venue, and Artist form builders in `forms.py` file. The WTForms are instantiated in the `app.py` file. For example, in the `create_shows()` function, the Show form is instantiated from the command: `form = ShowForm()`. To manage the request from Flask-WTF form, each field from the form has a `data` attribute containing the value from user input. For example, to handle the `venue_id` data from the Venue form, we did `show = Show(venue_id=form.venue_id.data)`, instead of using `request.form['venue_id']`.


2. **Create an empty repository in your Github account online. To change the remote repository path in your local repository, use the commands below:**
```
git remote -v 
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin <https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git>
git branch -M master
```
Once you have finished editing your code, you can push the local repository to your Github account using the following commands.
```
git add . --all   
git commit -m "your comment"
git push -u origin master
```

3. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**
```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```
>**Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:
```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

4. **Install the dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Run the development server:**
```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

6. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
